    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> In Mexican cuisine, Menudo, also known as pancita or mole de panza, is a traditional Mexican soup, made with cow's stomach in broth with a red chili pepper base. Hominy, lime, onions, 
        and oregano are used to season the broth. Menudo is traditionally prepared by the entire family, and often serves as an occasion for social interactions such as after 
        wedding receptions where the families of the newlyweds go to one of their family's houses to enjoy a bowl of menudo before and 
        after the ceremony. Menudo takes a long time to prepare as the tripe takes hours to cook.
