    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 cups of water</li>
        <li>1 cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>12 oz. can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water, rice and cinnamon sticks to a large saucepan and cook on medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and let cook for 16-18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain liquid from the sauce pan, remove cinnamon sticks and put rice back in the pan. Add all 3 milks - evaporated milk, condensed milk and whole milk to the pan. Let come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring constantly. The milk can easily burn so it's important to stir as much as possible as it thickens.</li>
        <li>Pour rice into cups and sprinkle on cinnamon. If you like more cinnamon, add 1 tsp of cinnamon in when adding the milks. Serve warm.</li>
